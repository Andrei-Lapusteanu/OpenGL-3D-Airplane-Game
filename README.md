# OpenGL-3D-Airplane-Game

# Summary

A simple 3D airplane game implemented using OpenGL and basic shaders. The framework was supplied to students during the course for which I was given this assignment

## Important
- I take no credit for the code regarding the framework
- My contribution is solely within the files found inside **Source\Laboratoare\Tema**

# Technologies
- Entire game coded in **C++** and using **OpenGL** syntax
- **Shaders** (Vertex, Fragment, Geometry) written in **GLSL**
- Most 3D models used have been modeled and exported using **Maya**

# Functionality
- As the airplane orbits the ocean planet continuously, your task is to avoid the bombs generated at random positions along your path, by maneuvering the plane vertically **with your mouse**
- You have in total 5 lives, and you lose one for each collision with a bomb
- The game is over when you deplete your lives (obviously)
- Press **F** to toggle between the **third person** and **first person camera**
